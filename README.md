Machine learning model (XGBoost) for the paper:
Explainable machine learning using echocardiography to improve mortality prediction in patients with chronic coronary syndrome

In this study we have developed a machine learning model to predict five-years mortality in patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) using clinical characteristics and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) data.
This model was trained on consecutive patients with CCS who attended the outpatient clinic of Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC.
The model was tested on patients who attended the outpatient clinic the Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location VUmc.
